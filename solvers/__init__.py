"""
Solvers for the optimization package
The following problems can be solved.
1) Linear programming (LP)
2) Quadratic programming (QP)
3) Linear conic programming (LCP)
4) Mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
5) Mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP)
6) Quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), convex and non-convex

The following packages can ba adopted in place of these packages.
1) CVXOPT
2) Mosek
3) Gurobi
4) CPLEX

The following packages are required for the data modelling
1) Numpy
2) Scipy*
3)

Notes:
    * Scipy is used for the sparse matrix functionalists, especially the csr_matrix function.
    todense and csr_matrix
