"""
The static and dynamic modelling of traffic-power systems
1ï¼‰The power flow modelling is based on the branch power flow modelling
2) The traffic network modelling is based on the improved time-space networks
3) The jointed modelling is a multiple-periods system, which includes a dynamic optimal flow problem for the transmission networks and multiple distribution networks
4) The scalable decomposition can be applied to manage a fleet of vehicles.
